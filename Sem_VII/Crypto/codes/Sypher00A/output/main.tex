\begin{Problem}
    \includegraphics[width=16.2cm]{./q.png}

\end{Problem}

\begin{Solution}
    \textbf{Steps}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item First we will find message and cipher text pair using \texttt{getPair()} function from
              \texttt{Utils.py} file

        \item Then we will select pairs of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ masks form the \texttt{Linear Approximation Table}
              where
              \begin{align}
                  abs(Lat[\alpha][\beta]) >= 4
              \end{align}
        \item For each pair of mask, we will find the values of counters \textbf{$T_0$}
              and  \textbf{$T_1$}
        \item Then we use Value of LHS(max from counter $T_0$ and $T_1$) to get correspondig equation as follows

              \begin{align}
                  (\alpha \cdot K_0) \oplus (\beta \cdot K_1)  = LHS
              \end{align}
              where LHS is as follows:


              \begin{align*}
                  LHS =
                  \begin{cases}
                      1 & \text{if } T_1 > T_0 \\
                      0 & \text{if } T_1 < T_0
                  \end{cases}
              \end{align*}

        \item Then we will get 8 eqution with 8 variables as follows

              \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
                  \hline
                  \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{$K_0$} & \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{$K_1$}                                                                   \\
                  \hline
                  $K_{00}$                    & $K_{01}$                    & $K_{02}$ & $K_{03}$ & $K_{10}$ & $K_{11}$ & $K_{12}$ & $K_{13}$ \\
                  \hline
              \end{tabular}

        \item
              Using \texttt{solver()} function we are eliminating key space 
              upto it resize to 1

        \pagebreak
        \item And finally we get our key as 
              \begin{align*}
                    K_0 = 15 \\
                    K_1 = 2 
              \end{align*}
    \end{enumerate}
    All this process is automated by the python file \texttt{Sypher00A.py}. (\textbf{Change Oracle path mention in main() function})
