### Gurobi

-   use gurobi to solve our problem , which is not tool for out problem
-   convert crypto problem to optimization problem
-   objective function , constraint --> LP,
-   variable --> MILP, ILP
-   gurobi --> MILP solver(size is less)

-   solver may take combination which is not possible
    or ddt contain at position (input,output) is 0
    which is not possible combination

-   starting input in not all 0 (trivial)
