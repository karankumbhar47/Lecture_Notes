## brute force

-   time more (2^k)
-   k is key size
-   (negl, 2^k, negl)

## code book

-   more data (2^b)
-   b block size
-   (2^b, negl, 2^b)

## 3 round AES

-   not secure
-

## distinguish attack

-   we can't distinguish between randomly
    generated and generated by algorithm

-   Attackers

    -   key recovery no ==> distinguish
        yes ==>
    -   ideal security (weakest thing should be protected)

    -   (easy attack)indistinguish --> plain --> key recovery (hard attack)
        (hard design) (easy desing)
    -   all distinguish attack not used to key recovery
    -   distinguish crack not able to explore(may be used to key recovery attack)

## AES Forword attack

-   More than brute force
-   backword attack (2^(-54)) (back form 1 round and forward from 2 round)
-   $S_7^{SB}$ --> round 7 after SB state
-
