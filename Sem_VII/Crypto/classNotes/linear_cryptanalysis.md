### xor
- symmetric difference

### Linear Cryptanalysis
- linear eq. --> easy to solve
- crypto --> non linear
- approx crypto sys. to linear system
- linear --> a^b , ~(a^b)
- non-linear --> a&b , a|b (sbox)

- hamming distance should be far from 50 (!=50)
- boolean funciton matches(approximate) if their most outputs  are same
- hamming distance (the number of places where both are not agree)
- hamminghamming  distance between two string

- KPA
    - know message and ciphertext
- bad sbox(non linear) (only diff)
    - sypher00A
- $Pr[\alpha ]$
- how much deviation (bias)
    - $p = \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon$
- we need to maximixe the $\epsilon$(bias).
- get relation between two keys
