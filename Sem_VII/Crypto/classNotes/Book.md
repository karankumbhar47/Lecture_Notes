### Book 
- read the book

### Linear approximation
- get 1 bit info(eliminate half key space)
- remove half of key space
- in KPA we know c,p
- $(\alpha \cdot m) \oplus (\beta \cdot c) = (\alpha \cdot k_0) \oplus (\beta \cdot k_1) $

- N enough  

### Sypher00C
- combined bias
- piling up lemma

- correct guess --> two counter goes away from each other 
- incorrect guess --> two counter goes closer to each other (closer to $\frac{N}{2}$)
