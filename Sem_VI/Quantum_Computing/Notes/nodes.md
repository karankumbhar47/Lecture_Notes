- period finding (factoring)

- w^m =1

**DFT**
- offset
- r period (upper remains after measurement)
- due to DFT changes period to 2^m/r (with no offset)

**QFT**
- quantum variant of DFT 
- after that measure 
- simple assumption
    - r evenly devides 2^m
- x (mesurement is multiple of 2^m/r)


**Protocol**
- basis (chosen) 
- basis matches (mesurement match)
- we know only communication (not actually what they measure)

- if in between (if dropper)
- random measurement (even basis same)
- prepare and measure (no basis then discard)
- 100 transmission (50 may match)
- after measurement know if dropper
- non passive
