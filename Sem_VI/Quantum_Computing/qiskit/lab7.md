## Lab 7

- constant or balance
- classical 4 --> 2 --> 1
            --> 2 evaluation to know balancing
- Quantum --> 1 operation 
          --> result = f(0) ^ f(1)
          --> result = 0 --> constant (f(0)==f(1));
          --> result = 1 --> balance (f(0)!=f(1));
          --> don't know what is f
          --> don't know the value of f(0) and f(1)
          --> final q bit manupulated to this result

- balance -->  H(x,f(x)) = 1
               H(0, 0)   = 1
               H(1, 0)   = 1

f(x) = 0
matrix = (1, 1)
         (0, 0)
         
- 1 qbit gate is not sufficient
- bit flip function convert 0 to 1 and 1 to 0
- unitary matrix --> same circut get same output as input(invertible)

- superposition not of use 
- worst than classical as we are getting values of f(0) and f(1), 
  but don't know what is f(0) and f(1)
- encoding in the form of f(x)

test--> big hint
david --> math
book --> topic (problems in short)
