Q1] Ans
  Given data
  Assumption are :
  1 Mb = 1000 Kb
  1 Kb = 1000 bits

  R1 = 10 Mbps 
     = 10 x 1000 x 1000  bits/seconds
     = 10000000 bits/seconds
     = 1 X 10^7 bits/seconds

  R2 = 200 Kbps
     = 200 x 1000 bits/seconds
     = 200000 bits/seconds
     = 2 x 10^5 bits/seconds

  R3 = 5 Mbps
     = 5 x 1000 x 1000 bits/seconds
     = 5000000 bits/seconds
     = 5 x 10^6 bits/seconds

  Part 1] Ans
      Assumption :  No other traffic in the network
      throughput for file transfer
            = min(R1,R2,R3)
            = R2
            = 200 Kbps

  Part 2] Ans
      taking value of X as :
              X = 5
      file size = X million bytes
                = 5 x 1000000 x 8 bits
                = 40000000 bits
                = 4 x 10^7 bits
      time taken to transfer file from A to B 
                = file size / throughput 
                = 4 x 10^7 (bits) / 2 x 10^5 (bits/seconds)
                = 200 seconds 

  Part 3] Ans
      If we double rate
        throughput = 2 x R2
                   = 400 Kbps
                   = 400 x 1000 bits/seconds
                   = 4 x 10^5 bits/seconds
        time taken to transfer file from A to B 
                   = file size / throughput
                   = 4 x 10^7 (bits) / 4 x 10^5 (bits/seconds)
                   = 100 seconds

Q2] Ans
  1. Straight-Through Ethernet Cable:
        Wiring Configuration: 
          The wiring arrangement is the same on both ends of the cable.This 
          is for contecting different devices and transmit pins of one end of the cable match 
          the receive pins of other, to ensure proper communication.

        Usage:
          - Generally connect devices in different layers  
          - Straight-through cables are most commonly used to connect different types of devices,
            such as a computer to a switch, router, or hub. 
          - Common Use Cases: Connecting a computer to a switch, router, or hub; connecting a 
            printer to a switch.


  2. Crossover Ethernet Cable:
      Wiring Configuration: 
        The wiring arrangement is different on the two ends of the cable. 
        The transmit pins on one end are connected to the receive pins on the other end, and 
        vice versa.

      Usage: 
        - Generally used to connect devices in same layers
        - Crossover cables are used to connect similar devices directly to each other, without 
          the need for an intermediate device like a switch or a router. They allow devices to 
          communicate without requiring a network hub or switch to reverse the transmit and 
          receive signals.
        - Common Use Cases: Connecting two computers directly to each other, connecting two 
          switches together without an intermediate device, connecting two routers together.

  3.Rollover Ethernet Cable (Console Cable):
      Wiring Configuration:
        A rollover cable is used for serial console connections to networking equipment like 
        routers and switches. We call it rollover, because pins of one end are reversed from the 
        other.

      Usage:
        - Rollover cables are primarily used to establish a direct console connection to network
          equipment. This connection allows administrators to access the device's command-line
          interface for configuration and troubleshooting.
        - Common Use Cases: Connecting a computer to the console port of a router or switch for 
          configuring network settings.
